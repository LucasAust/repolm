> Free to try: https://repolm.com
> 
> Here's how it works 🧵

**Tweet 2 (overview feature):**
> 📖 Overview Mode
> 
> Paste any repo and get a structured breakdown:
> - What it does (TL;DR)
> - Architecture & how it works
> - Key patterns & concepts
> - Tech stack analysis
> 
> Not a generic summary — it references actual files and functions from the code.

**Tweet 3 (podcast feature):**
> 🎙️ Podcast Mode
> 
> Two AI hosts (Alex & Sam) break down the codebase like friends geeking out.
> 
> Sam explains with analogies. Alex asks the questions you'd ask. They reference real function names from the repo.
> 
> You can listen to the audio or read the transcript.

**Tweet 4 (slides feature):**
> 📊 Slide Deck
> 
> Generates a presentation you can actually use:
> - Visual slide viewer with keyboard nav
> - Download as .pptx
> - Code snippets, key takeaways per slide
> 
> Great for study groups, team onboarding, or teaching.

**Tweet 5 (chat + immersive):**
> 💬 Chat with any codebase
> 
> Ask questions and get answers that reference specific files and functions.
> 
> Highlight any code in the viewer and ask "why is this done this way?" — it explains with full context.
> 
> Conversation history means follow-ups work naturally.

**Tweet 6 (levels):**
> 🎚️ Three expertise levels:
> 
> 🌱 Beginner — analogies, step-by-step, minimal code
> 🔧 Amateur — balanced code & explanation
> ⚡ Expert — code-heavy, skip the basics, discuss tradeoffs
> 
> Same repo, completely different experience depending on your level.

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
> First repo is free, no signup needed.
> 
> Try it: https://repolm.com
> 
> Built with FastAPI, Gemini, and edge-tts.

### r/learnprogramming

**Title:** I built a free tool that explains any GitHub repo at your skill level — overviews, podcasts, slides, and chat

**Body:**
Hey everyone — I built RepoLM because I was tired of staring at unfamiliar codebases trying to figure out how they work.

You paste a GitHub URL and it generates:
- A structured overview (architecture, key concepts, how it works)
- A podcast-style conversation between two hosts breaking it down
- A slide deck you can download as .pptx
- Interactive chat where you can ask questions about the code

The key thing: you pick your level. Beginner mode uses analogies and avoids jargon. Expert mode is code-heavy and discusses tradeoffs.

It also has a "Learning Paths" section with curated repos organized by concept — event-driven architecture, REST API design, state machines, testing patterns, etc.

First repo is free without even signing up. Would love feedback from actual learners.

### r/webdev

**Title:** Built a tool that generates architecture overviews, podcasts, and slides from any GitHub repo

**Body:**
I built RepoLM to solve the "how does this codebase actually work" problem.

Paste any GitHub URL and get:
- Architecture overview with TL;DR, collapsible sections, code references
- Podcast script (two hosts discussing the repo) with audio generation
- Slide deck with visual viewer + PPTX download
- Chat that understands the entire codebase

You choose depth (high-level vs low-level) and expertise (beginner/amateur/expert). Same repo, different output.

Tech stack: FastAPI, Gemini 2.5 Pro, edge-tts, SQLite. Handles concurrent users with thread pools and job queuing.

Free tier lets you try it without signing up. Feedback welcome.

### r/sideproject

**Title:** RepoLM — Paste a GitHub repo, get overviews, podcasts, and slides. Launched today.

**Body:**
Been building this for a few weeks. The idea: make any codebase learnable in minutes.

**What it does:**
- Paste a GitHub URL → get a structured overview, podcast conversation, slide deck
- Chat with the codebase — ask questions, highlight code, get explanations
- Three expertise levels (beginner → expert)
- Concept Lab: describe what you want to learn, AI generates a teaching repo and explains it
- 10 curated learning paths with real repos

**Revenue model:**
- Free tier with ads (Carbon Ads)
- Token packs ($5-$79)
- Pro subscription ($19/mo) and Team ($49/mo)
- Public API for developers
- Concept Lab (premium feature)

**Tech:** FastAPI, Gemini, edge-tts, SQLite, deployed on Railway.

Would love feedback on the product and the pricing. First repo is free.

### r/programming

**Title:** RepoLM: AI-powered tool that generates architecture overviews, podcasts, and slide decks from GitHub repos

**Body:**
[Keep it short for r/programming — they don't like self-promotion walls]

Built a tool that analyzes GitHub repos and generates structured learning content — overviews, podcast scripts with audio, slide decks with PPTX export, and interactive chat.

You pick your expertise level and it adapts: beginners get analogies, experts get code-heavy analysis with tradeoff discussions.

Free to try, no signup for first repo: https://repolm.com

Happy to answer questions about the approach or architecture.

## 🟠 Hacker News

**Title:** 
Show HN: RepoLM – Turn any GitHub repo into overviews, podcasts, and slides

**Body (first comment):**
Hi HN — I built RepoLM to make unfamiliar codebases learnable fast.

Paste a GitHub URL, pick your expertise level (beginner/amateur/expert), and get:

- Structured overview with architecture breakdown, key concepts, code references
- Podcast: two AI hosts discuss the repo conversationally (with audio generation)  
- Slide deck: visual viewer + .pptx download
- Chat: ask questions about the codebase with conversation context

The content adapts significantly based on level — beginner mode uses analogies and minimal code, expert mode is code-heavy with tradeoff analysis.

Also has curated "Learning Paths" (repos organized by concept) and a "Concept Lab" where you describe a concept and it generates a small teaching repo.

Stack: FastAPI, Gemini 2.5 Pro, edge-tts, SQLite, Railway.

Free to try: https://repolm.com

Feedback welcome — especially on output quality and what else would be useful.

## 🏹 Product Hunt (schedule for a Tuesday or Wednesday morning)

**Tagline:** Learn any GitHub codebase in minutes — AI overviews, podcasts, and slides

**Description:**
RepoLM turns any GitHub repository into learning content adapted to your skill level.

🎯 Paste a URL, pick beginner/amateur/expert
📖 Get architecture overviews with code references  
🎙️ Listen to two AI hosts break it down podcast-style
📊 Download presentation-ready slide decks
💬 Chat with the codebase — ask anything
🧪 Concept Lab: describe what you want to learn, get a custom teaching repo

Built for students, self-taught developers, and anyone who learns by reading code.

**First maker comment:**
I built RepoLM because reading unfamiliar codebases is one of the hardest parts of learning to code. Documentation is often outdated, and jumping between files hoping to understand the architecture wastes hours.

RepoLM analyzes the actual source code and generates content at your level. A beginner learning Express.js gets analogies and step-by-step explanations. A senior engineer gets code-heavy analysis with tradeoff discussions.

The podcast feature surprised me the most — hearing two hosts discuss a codebase conversationally is way more engaging than reading docs.

Would love your feedback on what to build next.
