<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">1. What RepoLM Is</h2>
<p>RepoLM is an AI-powered platform that analyzes public GitHub repositories and generates educational content including overviews, podcast-style explanations, slide decks, and interactive learning tools. We use large language models (currently Google Gemini) to create this content.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">2. Accounts</h2>
<p>You can use RepoLM with a free account (limited tokens) or a paid Pro subscription. You're responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. One account per person — no sharing accounts or creating multiple free accounts to bypass limits.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">3. Payments & Refunds</h2>
<p>Pro subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe. You can cancel anytime — your access continues until the end of the billing period. We don't offer refunds for partial months, but if something goes wrong on our end, reach out and we'll make it right.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Prices may change with 30 days' notice. We'll email you before any price increase takes effect.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">4. What You Can Do With Generated Content</h2>
<p>Content generated by RepoLM (overviews, podcasts, slides) is yours to use for personal learning, education, and internal team use. You may share individual pieces of generated content, but you may not bulk-export or resell generated content as a competing service.</p>
<p class="mt-2">The underlying source code of the repositories you analyze belongs to their respective owners. RepoLM doesn't grant you any rights to that code — we just help you understand it.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">5. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>Don't use RepoLM to:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-400">
<li>Abuse or overload our systems (automated scraping, excessive API calls)</li>
<li>Analyze private repositories without authorization</li>
<li>Generate content for illegal purposes</li>
<li>Circumvent usage limits or payment requirements</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">6. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Content generated by RepoLM is AI-produced and may contain inaccuracies. It's designed as an educational aid, not a definitive source of truth. Always verify critical information against the actual source code and official documentation.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>RepoLM is provided "as is." We do our best to keep the service running and accurate, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime or perfect content accuracy. We're not liable for any damages arising from your use of the service, including decisions made based on AI-generated content.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Our total liability is limited to the amount you've paid us in the past 12 months.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">8. Termination</h2>
<p>You can delete your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms. If we terminate your account without cause, we'll refund any unused prepaid subscription time.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-2">9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms occasionally. We'll notify you of significant changes via email or in-app notice. Continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated terms.</p>
